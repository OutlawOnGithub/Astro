  About this website, my server and my projects...   
---

### Hosting

I'm currently using an nginx instance on my own dedicated server (i9, so we are pretty large).
I might move to a dedicated docker container (or maybe Podman, as the ANSSI recommends it)

### What's also running on my server

Because my server is quite powerful, I'm running a few things on it right now, such as :
 - An ATM9 server (pretty ressource-hungry)
 - Two Discord bots :
     - IC3BERG (and its test version IC3BURK), my cybersec oriented bot
     - Wattsy, my community bot project (so far only displaying game stats)

### What I'd like to add in the future
I write this here so I don't forget :
 - an URL shortener
 - CTFs writeups
 - OSINT challenges
